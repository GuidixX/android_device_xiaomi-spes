# Android 11 Tree for spes

I have decided to adapt the fog Android 11 tree for spes in my free time, based on Jabiyeff's and NotKerd's work (Credits to them). For now the tree is not complete, so some bugs can be expected. Also it's just for fun and learning purposes.

### What works?
* Boots
* Selinux enforcing 
* RIL
* WiFi
* Mobile Data
* VoLTE
* Bluetooth
* Sound/Vibration
* Fingerprint
* Camera
* Flashlight
* GPS
* SDCard
* NFC

### What doesn't work, or isn't tested
* Refresh rate qs toggle is broken
